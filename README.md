# FC16UI
UI project of FC16, Department of Automation, Tsinghua University.

# Get Started
## Cocos-2dx
The UI project is based on cocos-2dx. So you have to firstly download cocos-2dx from <a href="https://cocos2d-x.org/filedown/cocos2d-x-3.17.1" target="_blank">cocos-2dx download link</a>. For windows system, run the command  
```bash
python setup.py
```
Then type 
```bash
cocos new -l cpp -p com.gamefromscratch.gamename -d C:\path\to\game\here gamename
```
to create a new project.  
We didn't include the cocos2d library necessary for the project.  
We should make sure the parent directory of this project contains the cocos2d library and some other files.  
Please refer to the tutorial given in <a href="https://www.gamefromscratch.com/page/cocos2d-x-CPP-Game-Programming-Tutorial-Series.aspx" target="_blank">tutorial page</a>.
